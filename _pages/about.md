Hi, I'm Anna, a graduate student at the University of Oxford pursuing an Integrated Master's in Biological Sciences. 

My academic interests are focused on bioinformatics, molecular biology, and data analysis. I have worked in various research environments including the Steve Kelly Lab at Oxford, the Altemose Lab at Stanford, and have contributed to projects related to gene expression, promoter shape analysis, and bacterial system design. In addition, I've held internships at Google and the Max Planck Institute, further broadening my experience in computational biology and software engineering.
